# BLE

BLE stands for **B**est **L**anguage **E**ver.  
It is an imperative programming language very loosely based on python.

You can use `exe.py` or `ble` to execute a ble file. Alternatively you can use `shell.py` or `blei` to enter the interactive command line interface. To view the interactive cli special commands just enter `help`.
